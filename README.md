My take on an AI Attendence system

# Camera Caupture
The Camera capture script is used to "scan" the persons face for better understanding of thier facial features.
By "scan" i mean rapidly take TONS of photos of the person of all angles to create a understanding of what they look like.

# Accuarcy
in testing, It's confidence is 99% on average. In training, it is 100% on average. Which means, in the furture self improving datasets willl be feasible. Without model collapse.
